# personal-portfolio-page
A showcase of work that I have completed to date, beautifully styled.

## This project shows some of the skills that I am developing in Coding BootCamp.
* I was able to make the styling flexible to different screen sizes, though I had some trouble along the way.
* I did my best to consolidate CSS styling.
* I realize just how important it is to have an outline for approaching a task.
